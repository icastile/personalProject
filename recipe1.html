          <h3>The bomb dot com</h3>
          <p>People spend their entire lives like I have trying to perfect the cookie. It doesnt really matter what kind of cookie we're talking about here, they can be hard to get the texture, taste, sweetness, and ooie gooie chewyness down. This is why I have created this recipe.    
          </p>

          <p> Now, i'll be honest... This isn't really my recipe, though I have altered it to be veganish, but the ingredients can be swapped if you choose. But like I said, you would never know the difference so I encourage you to try these out and see that you can indeed have a healthier alternative to regular cookies without sacrificing anything!  
          </p>

          <p>The first secret to these cookies is damn near burning the butter until it becomes brown, but not actually burning it on the stove. What this technique accomplishes is multifaceted. Firstly, you now have melted butter which everyone knows helps put everything together, but secondly and most important is the butter gives off a nice natural nutty auroma and flavor.</p>
          <p>The next trick is the "milk". Now I would recommend oat milk or almond milk because these are thicker than your normal soy, maybe even macadamia milk, but this choice is up to you. This milk helps keep the cookies moist and aids in the golden color of the cookies, plus its milk so thats a plus. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the flour is <em>Just as important</em> as the rest of the ingrediants. Choose the wrong flour and you might as well burn your house down and get the insurance money. You need <strong>BOB's Red Mill</strong> one-for-one gluten free flour. Believe me, I have tried many different kinds and this stuff is the best when it comes to replicating the soft fluffy texture that regular glutenous flour has.

        <div>
          <p>
            The next trick is coconut sugar. Now this sounds disgusting because who wants to use weird sugars that come from a nut you've probably never seen in your entire life. Well, you do. Why? Because coconut sure is cleaner, greener, healthier, and unlike white sugar and any other "normal" sugar, it isnt packed full of stuff that your body doesnt need or want. Coconut sugar is sweet and natural and great to use. The best part is, you only need <em>3/4 cup</em> of the stuff! If you really have a sweet tooth, you can bump it up to 1 cup, but i'd recommend just 3/4 cup and you and your family will love it. Plus it doesnt leave you feeling like a fat lump afterwards. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After you've mixed everything together, make sure to give the dough 30 minutes to rest and rise. This also allows all the ingredients to fully percolate and mix together.

                  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted start to whisk constantly. First the butter will begin to foam, then after a couple of minutes it will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan. Turn off the heat as soon as the solids turn brown and the butter gives off a nutty aroma. Pour into a glass mixing bowl to prevent burning.
