        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Four years ago my wife and I were sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. The only thing left to do was change our diet. And that's exactly what we did. Little did we know that this seemingly insignificant change would radically alter the way our household ran. We began as vegans. For three years we religiously followed the diet. No dairy products were on our kitchen table. We then altered that to a paleo diet and have now settled on what I call the perfect medium of food euporia. I am here to make all your food dreams come true. So strap on the apron, slick your hair back, and lets cook some food!</p>
